# Whyline for Java

The Whyline for Java is an interactive debugging tool that lets you ask "why" questions about program output. 

## History

This was the primary work of my Ph.D. thesis and amounted to about a year of development, testing, debugging, usability testing, and evaluation in 2007 and 2008, culminating in these publications:

* [Asking and Answering Questions about the Causes of Software Behavior](http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/papers/Ko2008Dissertation.pdf). Ko, A.J. (2008). Carnegie Mellon University, Dissertation.
* [Finding Causes of Program Output with the Java Whyline](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1518942). Ko, A.J. and Myers, B.A. (2009). ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), 1569-1578.A user interface for debugging that supports why and why not questions that enables developers to localize faults signficantly faster than breakpoint debuggers.
* [Extracting and Answering Why and Why Not Questions about Java Program Output](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1824761). Ko, A.J. and Myers, B.A. (2010). ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, 22(2), Article 4. An application of static and dynamic program slicing, precise call graphs, reachability analyses, and value provenance that enables developers to localize faults through why and why not questions.

Because of my academic job search in 2008, my position as a professor at the University of Washington, and the academic culture of doing _new_ work, rather than incrementing on old work, I moved on to other projects. That means that the code has likely experienced serious bitrot and could require significant work to make it executable again.

That said, at the time of writing this readme, it's 2016, eight years later, and I'm on sabbatical. It's about time I open source this thing and let the community more easily access and replicate the work!

## Support

Unfortunately, because I've long since moved on to other projects, I cannot support this code. Fork it, patch it, extend it: do whatever you like with it. It's here for the public good as an archive for future generations of developer tool developers.
